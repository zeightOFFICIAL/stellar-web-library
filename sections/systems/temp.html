                Alpha Centauri B, also known as Toliman, is the secondary star of the binary system. It is a
                main-sequence star of spectral type K1-V, making it more an orange colour than Alpha Centauri A; it
                has around 90% of the mass of the Sun and a 14% smaller diameter. Although it has a lower luminosity
                than A, Alpha Centauri B emits more energy in the X-ray band. Its light curve varies on a short time
                scale, and there has been at least one observed flare. It is more magnetically active than Alpha
                Centauri A, showing a cycle of 8.2±0.2 yr compared to 11 years for the Sun, and has about half the
                minimum-to-peak variation in coronal luminosity of the Sun. Alpha Centauri B has an apparent
                magnitude of +1.35, slightly dimmer than Mimosa.

            Proxima Centauri has two known exoplanets and one candidate exoplanet: Proxima Centauri b, Proxima Centauri
            d and the disputed Proxima Centauri c. Proxima Centauri b orbits the star at a distance of roughly
            0.05 AU (7.5 million km) with an orbital period of approximately 11.2 Earth days. Its estimated mass is at
            least 1.17 times that of Earth. Proxima b orbits within Proxima Centauri's habitable zone-the range
            where temperatures are right for liquid water to exist on its surface-but, because Proxima Centauri is a red
            dwarf and a flare star, the planet's habitability is highly uncertain.

        <div class="normal-border alpha p-solar">
            Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf, because it belongs to the main sequence on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram
            and is of spectral class M5.5. The M5.5 class means that it falls in the low-mass end of M-type dwarf
            stars, with its hue shifted toward red-yellow by an effective temperature of ~3,000 K.

                Sun and part of the triple star system Alpha Centauri. It is approximately 4.2 ly (1.3 pc) from Earth in
                the constellation Centaurus, making it, along with the disputed Proxima c, and Proxima d the closest

                mi) with an orbital period of approximately 11.2 Earth days. Its other properties are only poorly
                understood, but it is believed to be a potentially Earth-like planet with a minimum mass of at least
                1.07 M. The planet orbits within the habitable zone of its star. It is, however, not known whether or
                not it has an atmosphere. Proxima Centauri is a flare star with intense emission of electromagnetic
                radiation that could strip an atmosphere off the planet. The planet's proximity to Earth offers an
                opportunity for robotic space exploration, for example, with the Breakthrough Starshot project.
