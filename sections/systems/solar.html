                The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect ball of hot
                plasma,
                heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core. The Sun radiates this
                energy mainly as
                light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation, and is the most important source of energy for
                life on Earth.

            take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to escape the core, is the source of the Sun's
            light and heat.

                The Modern English word Earth developed, via Middle English, from an Old
                English noun most often spelled eorde. It has cognates in every Germanic
                language, and their ancestral root has been reconstructed.
                In its earliest attestation, the word eorde was already
                being used to translate the many senses of Latin terra and
                Greek: the ground, its soil, dry land, the human world, the surface
                of the world (including the sea), and the globe itself.
                As with Roman Terra/Tellus and Greek Gaia, Earth may have been a
                personified goddess in Germanic paganism: late Norse mythology
                included Jord ('Earth'), a giantess often given as the mother of Thor.

                with a thin atmosphere (less than 1% that of Earth's), and has a crust primarily composed of
                elements similar

                    Schiaparelli's "canali" observations combined with
                    Percival Lowell's books on the subject put forward
                    the standard notion of a planet that was a drying,
                    cooling, dying world with ancient civilizations.

                    to Babylonian astronomy, in which the planet was named
                    for the god Nergal, deity of war and destruction.
                    It persisted into modern times, as exemplified by Gustav
                    Holst's orchestral suite The Planets, whose famous
                    first movement labels Mars "the bringer of war".</p>

                    opposition from the Sun can range from about -3.0 to -1.4.
                    The minimum brightness is magnitude +1.86 when the
                    planet is near aphelion and in conjunction with the

                During the late nineteenth century, it was
                widely accepted in the astronomical community
                that Mars had life-supporting qualities,
                including the presence of oxygen and water.
                However, in 1894 W. W. Campbell at Lick
                Observatory observed the planet and found that
                "if water vapor or oxygen occur in the
                atmosphere of Mars it is in quantities
                too small to be detected by spectroscopes
                then available". That observation contradicted
                many of the measurements of the time and was
                not widely accepted. Campbell and V. M.
                Slipher repeated the study in 1909 using
                better instruments, but with the same results.
                It wasn't until the findings were confirmed
                by W. S. Adams in 1925 that the myth of the
                Earth-like habitability of Mars was finally
                broken. However, even in the 1960s,
                articles were published on Martian biology,
                putting aside explanations other than
                life for the seasonal changes on Mars.
                Detailed scenarios for the metabolism and
                chemical cycles for a functional ecosystem
                were being published as late as 1962.

                Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around
                the Sun takes
                87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god
                Mercurius (Mercury),
                god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to
                the Greek
                god Hermes.

                Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. It is tidally
                locked with the Sun in a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance, meaning that
                relative to the fixed stars, it rotates on its axis exactly three times
                for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun. As seen from the Sun,
                in a frame of reference that rotates with the orbital motion,
                it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian years.
                An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day
                every two Mercurian years.
