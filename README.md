### Description

An online library of the universe, objects in it, patterns and other scientific facts. The site provides the user with information from various sources and different formats to study and gain knowledge. The information presented on this site can be used to obtain basic knowledge about the universe both in educational institutions and for personal purposes. Information formats: vector images of various star systems, text describing individual facts or general information about some objects, raster images of some particularly important objects, embedded video and audio. The main goal is to increase the user's awareness of the structure of the Universe, galaxies and star systems within it. Main advantages: modularity, simplicity and ease of navigation. Level of knowledge: between basic and intermediate.

### Features

#### Main menu

Simple yet elegant solution for navigating through different pages of the library.

#### Universe page

##### Star system page
The first and main goal of this project is to improve people's awareness of the structure and content of the Universe. The star system page was the first thing created during development. This is the main page that allows the user to look at various space systems, gain some knowledge, and learn.

The page is divided into three parts from left to right: the navigation bar, the information bar, and the visual system layout. Each panel provides a convenient way to explore and learn. The leftmost panel is the navigation panel, which contains three buttons, from top to bottom: open object side panel, open star side panel, return to universe page. 

The objects' sidebar lists the most prominent objects in the stellar system. Each name is clickable and will eventually display information about the selected item in the center and right panels. Additionally, when you hover over an object, it will be highlighted in the system layout panel. It utilizes simply JS scripts and forced styles to open/close, hover-highlight, click/show.

The star sidebar lists all available star systems, it shows every single one of them currently implemented as predifined or from DB.
